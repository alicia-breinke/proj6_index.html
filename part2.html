<h1><em>You obviously feel threatened by those “kids,” so you berate them and slam them.  But the awful words, “lesbian skinhead,” or the fake picture of  that same girl, ripping up that document are proof that there is a new low.  And I do realize that some of you may have apologized for your words.  Still, let me ask you something.  Have you been through something that traumatic?  Have you been through a shooting that injured or took people you care for?  If not, please think twice before you slam these kids in the future. </em></h1>
