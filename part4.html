<h1><em>These are a few of the main requests I ask of you.  But before I end this letter I kindly ask you to please do us a favor and listen.  Listen to those “kids” advocating for change while also having to grieve for the seventeen people who were killed.  I know you might want to instead extinguish their efforts.  But their words will keep burning until you really listen.</em></h1>
<h2>Kindly,</h2>
