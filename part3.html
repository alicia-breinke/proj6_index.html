<h1><em><center>Although I understand your organization may not want to surrender your weapons for the sake of business, it does concern me that the person involved in the Florida shooting was showing he had major problems yet had an assault rifle.  With this said, I do ask that you start listening to our requests for stricter gun laws so these dangerous weapons do not end up in the wrong hands.  I know it's probably not in your best interest to do this.  But just think about how many teachers, students, or friends will be saved if you try and listen to our words.</center></em></h1>
